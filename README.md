# RecipeBlogFrontEnd

This project is a reattempt of a front end made for a previous project. The purpose of this project is for me to practice coding in Angular (in this case, a faux blog page).

# If you'd like to contribute:
- Fork this repo
- It's an angular front end so don't forget your npm install for dependencies
- 'ng serve' to start running in development mode

# Updates
