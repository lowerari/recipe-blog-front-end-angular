# RecipeBlogFrontEnd

This project is a reattempt of a front end made for a previous project. The purpose of this project is for me to practice coding in Angular (in this case, a faux blog page).

# Updates

- Home page completed!
- Login and signup pages completed! (as of yet no connection to back end)
- Blogs page is laid out (still no connection to back end yet)
- Post page completed! (but not linked to back end)
- Individual blog page styled! (no, no back end yet)
- Edit and delete modals made! (but don't do anything yet)
