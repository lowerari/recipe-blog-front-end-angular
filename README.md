# RecipeBlogFrontEnd

This project is a reattempt of a front end made for a previous project. The purpose of this project is for me to practice coding in Angular (in this case, a faux blog page).

# Updates

- Home page completed!
- Login and signup pages completed! (as of yet no connection to back end)
- Blogs page is laid out (still no connection to back end yet)
- Post page completed! (but not linked to back end)
- Individual blog page styled! (no, no back end yet)
- Edit and delete modals made! (but don't do anything yet)
- Signup and login are attached to the back end!
- Blogs page getting blogs from back end and only accessible to logged in users.
- Post page is working with the back end to post new blogs.
- Individual blog page is getting the individual blog from the back (no comments yet)
- Comments for individual blogs retrieved from back end
- Can post a comment to a blog
- Blogs and comments can be edited and deleted by their authors

# To do:
- Add error handling to login and signup
- Truncate titles on blogs if they are too long
- Create error page for blogs and post pages if user is not logged in
- Add "there are no comments yet!"
- See if it's possible to separate content into paragraphs (at least if it was submitted that way)
- Make edit and delete only appear for author of comment/blog
- Deploy!
