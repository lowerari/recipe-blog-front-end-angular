# RecipeBlogFrontEnd

This project is a reattempt of a front end made for a previous project. The purpose of this project is for me to practice coding in Angular (in this case, a faux blog page).

# Updates

- Home page completed!
- Login and signup pages completed! (as of yet no connection to back end)
